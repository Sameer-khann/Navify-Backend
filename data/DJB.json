We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.\nYou can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.\nYour License to Use the Services\nWe give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license cannot be assigned, gifted, sold, shared or transferred in any other manner to any other individual or entity without X’s express written consent.

Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or any of the X trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain our and our licensors' exclusive property. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding X, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.\nMisuse of the Services\nYou also agree not to misuse the Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.

See https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens to your information.\nWe may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or our Rules and Policies; (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct; (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5, 6, and the misuse provisions of Section 4 (“Misuse of the Services”). If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals).

You agree that these amounts are (i) a reasonable estimate of our damages; (ii) not a penalty; and (iii) not otherwise limiting of our ability to recover from you or others under any legal or equitable theory or claim, including but not limited to statutory damages and/or equitable relief. You further agree that repeated violations of these Terms will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive and/or equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages.\n6. General\nWe may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at https://x.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\nTo the extent permitted by law, all disputes related to these Terms or the Services, including without limitation disputes related to or arising from other users’ and third parties’ use of the Services and any Content made available by other users and third parties on the Services, will be brought exclusively before a competent court in Ireland without regard to conflict of law provisions and will be governed by Irish law, notwithstanding any other agreement between you and us to the contrary. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction and venue over the claim. To the extent permitted by law, you also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or representative action proceeding.\n\nYou and X agree that you must initiate any proceeding or action within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute that is arising out of or related to these Terms. Otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you forever waive the right to pursue any claim or cause of action, of any kind or character, based on such events or facts, and such claims or causes of action are permanently barred.\nIn the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe X User Agreement is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X User Agreement shall take precedence.

    "content": "X Privacy Policy\nEffective: November 15, 2024\n\nBefore you scroll, read this\nIt’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.\nWith that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.\nSo if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:\n\nX is a public platform\nLearn what’s viewable & searchable\nWe collect some data\nabout you\nLearn what we collect & how\nAffiliate services may have their own policies\nLearn about affiliates\nWe use your data to make X better\nLearn how we make your info work\nYou can control your experience\nLearn how to update your settings\nIf you have questions about how we use data, just ask\nLearn how to contact us\n1. Information We Collect\nThe information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.\n1.1 Information you provide us.\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\nPreferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.\nBiometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.\nJob Applications / Recommendations. We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.\n1.2 Information we collect when you use X.\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including:\nPurchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.\nDevice Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:\nLocation Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\nInferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:\nLog Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:\nAdvertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).\nCookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\nInteractions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.\n1.3 Information we receive from third parties.\nWhen you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us. \n \n Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers. Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\nOther Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.\n2. How We Use Information\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\n\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\n2.2  Foster safety and security.\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\n2.5 Research.\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.\n3. Sharing Information\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\n3.1 When you post and share.\nWith the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings).\n\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\nWith partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\n3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.\nWith advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\nThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\n3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\nWe may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.\n3.4 With our Affiliates.\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\n3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.\n4. How Long We Keep Information\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\nWe may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.\n5. Take Control\n5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.\nYou can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.\nYou can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here.\nYou can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here.\nTo protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.\n5.2 Deleting your Information.\nIf you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\n5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.\nYou can manage your privacy settings and other account features here. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others.\n5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.\nTo submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.\n6. Your Rights and Ours\nWe provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.\n6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.\nX has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.\n6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.\nJust as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.\nWe also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us here. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.\nX is a participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us here. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body JAMS, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in Annex 1 to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF here.\n7.

    "content": "How X Ads work\nHow X Ads work\nWe want to show you ads that you find interesting and useful. Here's an overview of how X Ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings, and other options.\nWhat are X Ads?\nYou may see different kinds of ads on X, including Promoted Ads, Follower Ads, and Spotlight Takeover. We may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of X. They are clearly marked with an “Ad” label. You can interact with most promoted content in much the same way as organic content. If you follow, like, or repost content on X, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content.\nWhy you see certain X Ads\nYour activity on X, the information you provide to X, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you.\nWhen you use X to follow, post, search, view, or interact with posts or X accounts, we may use these actions to customize X Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if location features are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer.\nX may also personalize ads based on information that X and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie ID).\nThis helps X display ads about things you’ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, you could receive a Promoted Ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. You could also see this business as a Follower Ad in one of your \"Who to Follow\" suggestions. Learn more about your privacy controls for personalized ads.\nManaging your privacy settings\nWe're committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices.\nIf you don't want X to show you interest-based ads on and off of X, there are several ways to turn off this feature:\nUsing your X settings, visit the \"Personalization and data settings\" and adjust the \"Personalize ads\" setting.\nIf you're on web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt-out of seeing interest-based advertising from X in your current browser.\nOn iOS 13 and earlier only, if you don't want X to show you interest-based ads in X for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions).\nOn Android, if you don't want X to show you interest-based ads in X for Android on your current mobile device, enable “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android phone’s settings (precise directions and name of the setting may be different on different Android versions and OEM Android variants).\nNote: Please confirm that you're logged in if you want to view or change the web settings for your X account. Changing your X settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect behavior on that browser while you're not logged in to X. Learn more about how to access your personalization and data settings, including in your X mobile app.\nX also works with third-party advertising partners, including Google, to market X’s own services and serve ads on behalf of X advertisers, including through the delivery of interest-based ads. The privacy options described here apply to interest-based ads served by or on X; they do not apply to ads served by these other companies off of X, including on X's behalf. You can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based ads from other companies at optout.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org/choices. If you're on the web, you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s opt-out browser add-on, and opt-out of interest-based Google ads using Google Ads settings.\nOn iOS version 14 and later only, if you do not want X to access your iOS Identifier for Advertising, disable the “Allow Apps to Request to Track” setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions).\nIn addition, whether you're logged in or logged out, you always have the option to \"dismiss\" Promoted Ads and/or accounts that you're not interested in seeing. This feedback helps us show you better promoted content.\nHow can I run X Ads?\nEligible accounts can launch campaigns at ads.X.com. For more information, visit getting started with X Ads campaigns\nReady to get started?\nDid someone say … cookies?\n\n  X and its partners use cookies to provide you with a better, safer and\n  faster service and to support our business. Some cookies are necessary to use\n  our services, improve our services, and make sure they work properly.\n  Show more about your choices."
